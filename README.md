this is a rust tutorial


variables
```rust
//variables in rust are really cool
fn main() {
  let x = 6;
  //x is uneditable
  //if we tried to do â†’ x = 8; it would give an error
  
  let mut y = 5;
  //adding mut means we can now edit the variable
  y = 89; #this would work
}
```

printing in rust

without printing you wouldn't be able to print the variables!

```rust
fn main() {
    println!("hello world!");
    //println! is the function name and it prints to the terminal
    //output: hello
    let x = 9;
    println!("x = {}",x)
    //adding "{}",x tells the machine to print x
}
```

user input
```rust
use std::io; //imports

fn main() -> io::Result<()> {
    let mut user_input = String::new();
    let stdin = io::stdin(); // We get `Stdin` here.
    stdin.read_line(&mut user_input);

    println!("input {} ", user_input);

    Ok(())
}
```
step 4:screw rust c++ is better
